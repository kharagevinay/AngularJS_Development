3. AJS Features.

Ans :-
	
	1.	Structural Programming :-
									AJS is a structural programming.
									
									It uses MVC structure (pattern) to developing application.
									
									In MVC structure, application development is split into three modules,
									
									Model		-		Data Storage
									
									View		-		Data Presentation
									
									Controller	-		Data Processing
									
									MVC structure makes development, testing, maintenance (modifications) will be more comfortable.
									
									
	2.  Data Binding :-
							Data Binding is the primary feature of AJS.
							
							In Data Binding, Model data is bind with view (HTML Tage).
							
							First time in client side framework, AJS introduced this Data Binding concept.
							
							This feature will reduce lot of client side coding which is related to data presentation (View).
							
							Due to Data Binding, if model updates view will update automatically.
							
							
	3.  Parallel Develpment :- 
								In AJS application, multiple programmers works parallel on controllers, Models and Views.
								
								We are creating in separate files to implement each module.
								
								eg.
									View				-		*.html
									
									Controller/Model	-		*.js
									
								Controller handles the Model data.
								
								This feature makes your application development more faster.
								
								If you write view content and controller code in same file, only one programmer will work at a time.
								
								
	4. HTML as Template :-
							AJS uses existing HTML tages as a template for views preperation.
							
							AJS provides directives (like attribues) to implement these template.
							
							At the time of execution AJS framework executes these template to generate actual content.
							
							eg.
								<ul>
									<li ng-repeat = " item in ar ">
										{{ item}}
									</li>
								</ul>
								
	5. Highly Testable :-
							AJS application are more comfortable to perform Unit Testing.
							
							Due to MVC structure, we can easily test required module in the application.
							
							AJS applications are tested by using Test Automation tools like "Jasmine" and "Karma".
							
							
	6. Routing Support For SPA :-
									SPA means Single Page Application.
									
									In SPA, only main page will loaded from server.
									
									Remaining all requests are processed at client side without reloading the whole page.
									
									AJS Routing concept organizing multiple routes for multiple requests within single page.
