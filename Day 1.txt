2.	MVC in AJS.

Ans.	AJS is a structural framework for developing dynamic web applications.

		According to MVC pattern, application development process is split into three modules:-
		
		1.	Model		-		Data Storage.
		
		2.	View		-		Presentation Logic.
		
		3.	Controller	-		Processing Logic.
		
		
		1. 	Model :-
						Model is responsible for data storage related logic.
						
						An AJS model is implemented by using Javascript variables, arrays and objects.
						
						At the time of execution of database related applications, model data will be exchanged beetween client and server using AJAX.
						
		2.	View  :-
						View is responsible for presentation ( UI ) logic.
						
						View will take care of how to display model data end-user.
						
						In AJS, views are implemented by using HTML, CSS and AJS directives.
						
	Note :-	
			AJS directives are similar to HTML attributes.
			
				
		3. 	Controller :-
							Controller is responsible for processing logic.
							
							It prepares model data and make it avaliable to view.
